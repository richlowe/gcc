# We need to use -fPIC when we are using gcc to compile the routines in
# crtstuff.c.  This is only really needed when we are going to use gcc/g++
# to produce a shared library, but since we don't know ahead of time when
# we will be doing that, we just always use -fPIC when compiling the
# routines in crtstuff.c.
#
# We must also enable optimization to avoid having any code appear after
# the call & alignment statement, but before we switch back to the
# .text section.
